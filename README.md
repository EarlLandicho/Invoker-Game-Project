# Why am I creating this game?

This game allows me to do what I'm passionate about: creating games. Above 90% percent of what you see here is made by myself, art/animation and programming included. I've had some help 
from third party modules that were widely used. Making this game gives me an opportunity to show off what I can do with Unity, as well as what kind of art I can produce myself.
This game has been in development for some months and I work on it on my free time as a passion project and as a sharpening tool as a programmer.
