# Invoker (Game Summary)

![](sample.gif)

Invoker is a 2D bullet-hell, adventure game that lets you combine spirits to cast different spells. There are three different spirits that you can use. 
You can combine up to three spirits, making the total number of spells to be 19. Spells allow you to damage enemies, maneuver more easily, protect/heal yourself, and 
allows you to creatively combo them to increase their potency. You can poison, stun, and burn enemies. Enemies may inflict these status effects on you as well and may kill you if you don't dispel them with you spells. Each spirit is given to you one-by-one and you can discover what kind of spells you can create by combining them. Each spell has a cooldown on its own, so you have to keep using different spells if you want to constantly dish out damage. Using different spells and killing enemies fills up a combo bar that increases improves all your spells. Be sure to keep casting and killing enemies because this bar drains over time. The game rewards creativity and fast actions per minute.

Invoker is made using c# and Unity as the engine. I use Aseprite to create the pixel art.

# Why am I creating this game?

This game allows me to do what I'm passionate about: creating games. Above 90% percent of what you see here is made by myself, art/animation and programming included. I've had some help 
from third party modules that were widely used. Making this game gives me an opportunity to show off what I can do with Unity, as well as what kind of art I can produce myself.
This game has been in development for some months and I work on it on my free time as a passion project and as a sharpening tool as a programmer. As of now the name "Invoker" is not set in stone. I may or may not change this name depending on how development goes. I may think of a better name someday.
